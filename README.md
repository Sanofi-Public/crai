# CrAI

This is the accompanying code for the paper "Finding Antibodies in Cryo-EM densities with CrAI" by Vincent Mallet, Chiara Rapisarda, Herv√© Minoux and Maks Ovsjanikov.
The goal of this tool is to predict the position and orientation of antibodies in Cryo-EM densities.

## Installation

### ChimeraX

The easiest way to use the tool is through ChimeraX, as our tool is packaged as a ChimeraX bundle.
The Chimerax toolshed is a [hosted repository](https://cxtoolshed.rbvi.ucsf.edu/) of bundles wheels.
To install the tool, simply type in the ChimeraX command line :

```shell
# Chimerax command line
toolshed install crai
```

**This might not work,** if it did, you can skip the following.
At the time of writing, the tool is not yet registered, so the bundle can be installed by using the copy on this repository instead.
On the system command line type :

```shell
# system command line
git clone https://github.com/Sanofi-GitHub/crai
cd crIA-EM
chimerax --nogui --cmd "toolshed install ChimeraX_crai-0.1-py3-none-any.whl; exit"
```

The tool should now be installed in Chimerax.
Once installed, the tool can be used from the Chimerax Command line. 
Examples below include :
```shell
# Chimerax command line
help crai
crai #1 outname YOURNAME.pdb
```

### Command line usage

The first thing you will need is a computing environment :

```shell
conda create -n crai -y
conda activate crai
conda install -c schrodinger pymol
#conda install pytorch=1.13 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia # For cuda support
conda install pytorch=1.13 cpuonly -c pytorch # For cpu 
pip install wget requests pandas tqdm mrcfile scikit-learn scipy mmtf-python matplotlib tensorboard cripser
```

Then, clone the project and go to the root of the project :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Sanofi-GitHub/crai
cd crIA-EM
```

Finally, one can run predictions on one or several systems by running the command
```shell
conda activate crai
python crai_predict.py -h  # To see a help menu
python crai_predict.py --in PATH_TO_MAP.map  # Single prediction
python crai_predict.py --in PATH_TO_DIR --predict_dir  # Directory prediction
```
